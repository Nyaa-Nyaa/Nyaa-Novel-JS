Introduction (Take 2)
=============
This project is intended to be a modular javascript visual novel engine. Intended to work on all platforms complaint with HTML/JS/CSS. I will continue to add more to this README when the projects progresses.

This is intended to be run off-line and not hosted. However, it will work perfectly fine when configured for on-line use on a webserver. You don't even need a pre-processor, all client side.
